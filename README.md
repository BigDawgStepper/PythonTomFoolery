Doing random shizzle in python

If you are reading this i assume you have stmbled upon this from google trying to figure stuff out in python or maybe a friend reffered you for reasons im about to explain.
If you are new to Python this might just help you a bit as this is just a bunch of random scripts ive made in python that anyone can do whatever tf they want with ðŸ¤‘
Thats why this is also a great spot to learn from all my mistakes as at the time of writing this (2024-05-20) im near brand new to Python with 3 days of learning so far so this will contain scripts from the day i started (LINUX MULTITOOL FIRST SCRIPT EVER MADE THAT IS MINE AND FINISHED)
So you can easily look through all my scripts and projects for learning and maybe to borrow some things because like said anyone can do whatever tf they want with these.
If you found this because my name was in a script that gave you malware there should be a copy of that script here so you can see the malware was added by someone else after the fact.
